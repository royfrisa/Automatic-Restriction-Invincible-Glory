# Automatic-Restriction-Invincible-Glory
This is the program that will enable text message for team members to send daily report at 7:00 PM daily and disable text message at 10:00 PM daily.

This is Thar Htet Aung from the Graphic Design Department. Over the past four months, our team has been manually enabling and disabling text message permissions for daily reports. This repetitive task has been challenging to keep up with, and we occasionally forget to enable the text messaging at the scheduled time.

As Iâ€™ve been learning more about Python and its modules, I wondered if I could create a program to automate this process. So i tried to create a program that will automatically enable text message permissions at 7:00 PM and disable them at 10:00 PM daily.
